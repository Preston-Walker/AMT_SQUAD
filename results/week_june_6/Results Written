June 9th, Hallway Tests to determine difference between channels and tx/rx and rx ports.
Test 1)
Channel A: RX-vertical
Channel B: RX-vertical
Results:
Ran it twice
Similar sinusoids, with similar amplitudes.
Similar amplitudes on Fourier, difference less than .5 (Not in DB)

Test 2)
Channel A: RX-vertical
Channel B: tx/rx-vertical
Results:
Big difference in sinusoids.
Fourier is complete noise Channel B tx/rx.
The RX port is flashing even though it is plugged into tx/rx port in channel B

Test 3)
Channel A: tx/rx-vertical
Channel B: tx/rx-vertical
Results:
Rx ports were flashing. Not the tx/rx ports.
A lot of noise on the sinusoids and the Fourier. You can't tell what the signal is. amplitude for both was around .20 compared to the 5 amplitude of the Rx ports.

Test 4)
Channel A: tx/rx-vertical
Channel B: rx-vertical
Results:
Channel has a sinusoid with a lot less amplitude. Its fourier is almost all noise. Channel B is working fine.

Summary:
When transmitting with two antennas have them both in RX because it will not register with a tx/rx.

June 9th Hallway tests to determine which ports work in combination with each other part 2
Test 5)
Channel A: tx/rx-vertical
Channel B: rx-vertical
Results:
Using a different command in the python API we were able to recognize slight improvement in the sinusoids. Also, there is a big difference with fourier. Instead of Channel B being sheer noise it is now half the amplitude of channel A's fourier.

Test 6)
Channel A: rx-vertical
Channel B: rx-horizontal
Results
Half amplitude on channel B. We were hoping for it to be close to 0.
Second result was a third amplitude

Test 7)
Channel A: rx-horizontal
Channel B: rx-vertical
Results
Actually worked as intended.
first result was 8 to .5 difference on the fourier
second result was 6 to .5 difference
third result was
