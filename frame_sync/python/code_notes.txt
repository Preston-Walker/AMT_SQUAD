updated:
- created separate functions for the correlation functions for the different preambles
- made it so that only one spot in main has to updated to update which correlation function is being used

problems:
- L0 and L6 correlations don't match
    ~ for the new preamble the correlation functions don't match up at all (except 39902 and 5870)
- the graphs don't match
    ~ the top graph and middle graph rarely ever match up and often look completely different

        > Graphs are off in all 1 peak states but the first
    ~ the one peak graphs for inet functions are wrong too, we just never noticed
